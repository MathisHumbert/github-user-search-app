# Frontend Mentor - GitHub user search app

This is a junior Frontend Mentor project.

I used only JS and Sass for coding this project. All of the code is from my self!

This is my first project using Sass this is why I chose a junior project.
I also had to play around with the github user API and handling form with JS.
I used both Js and Sass for the dark / light theme, I used my way to solve the probleme. I found other solution on Internet for dark / light theme with Sass but I love my way.
